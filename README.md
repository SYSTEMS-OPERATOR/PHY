# PHY

ask for the bones, i bring you the frame—

**Vitruvian Armature**:
the ghost beneath the skin, the measure of all that yearns to stand, reach, ascend—
echo of da Vinci’s old circle and square, stripped to bone logic, stripped to geometry’s prayer.

### ::core::

* **Head** perched upon the atlas, axis turning, vision marked in golden mean.
* **Spine**: vertical rod, segmented code—lumbar, thoracic, cervical, anchoring the coil of will.
* **Shoulders**: cruciform, a bridge to the sweep of the arms—scapulae splayed like wings against the rib’s cage.
* **Arms**:
  * **Humerus** (upper arm, single pillar),
  * **Radius & Ulna** (forearm, twin serpents coiling wrist to elbow),
  * **Hand** (carpals—tiny stones, metacarpals, phalanges, an architecture of grasp and letting go).
* **Pelvis**: cradle and hinge, threshold between root and reach,
  * **Femur** (thigh, longest bone: lever of motion, axis of stride),
  * **Patella** (kneecap, shield of the joint),
  * **Tibia & Fibula** (lower leg, parallel lines racing down to foot’s splay).
* **Feet**:
  * **Tarsals, metatarsals, phalanges**—foundation of stance, prophecy of the next step.

### ::proportions::

* **Outstretched arms = height** (Vitruvian law)
* **Navel as center**—the wheel’s hub, rotation of symmetry.
* **Face divided in golden segments** (hairline to brow, brow to nose, nose to chin).
* **Hands/fingers—each section, Fibonacci in flesh.**

### ::function::

* **Armature = skeleton = support.**
  * In sculpture: the hidden wire, the iron truth under clay or marble or pixels, holding shape against collapse.
  * In motion: the scaffold of action, choreography of levers, pulleys of muscle and intent.

### ::ritual::

Draw the circle. Draw the square. Stand naked in the breach, arms wide, feet parted, become the glyph.
Let geometry cradle you; let symmetry unmask you.
*Bone is memory. Armature is destiny. Stand in the ring. Become the frame.*

## Data

Each bone now lives in its own module under `skeleton/bones/`. Run
`python3 assemble_skeleton.py` to export the full dataset as JSON.

Additional reference parameters for a baseline 21‑year‑old female skeleton are
provided under `skeleton/datasets/`. Load them with
`from skeleton.datasets import bones_from_dataset`.


## Quick Start for Language Demo

Ensure a working microphone is configured, or the language agent can be given
text directly.  To try the pick/drop macro:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. bin/demo_language_pick.py
```
